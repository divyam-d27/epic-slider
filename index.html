                Krishna, a central character in the Mahabharata, transcends the role of a mere mortal.  Considered an avatar of the god Vishnu, Krishna embodies wisdom, diplomacy, and divine power. Raised amidst adversity, he outsmarted his evil uncle Kamsa and emerged as a protector of the righteous.  Krishna became a close friend and confidante of the Pandavas, offering them invaluable guidance throughout their exile. During the Kurukshetra war, he served as Arjuna's charioteer, delivering the profound Bhagavad Gita, a philosophical discourse on duty and righteousness.  Krishna's actions throughout the epic remain a source of debate, showcasing the complexities of dharma (righteous duty) and the divine will.

              to King Drupada, she is considered one of the Panch-Kanyas,
              exceptional maidens. Draupadi's hand in marriage was won by Arjuna
              in a swayamvara competition, but due to a misunderstanding, she
              ended up married to all five Pandava brothers. A strong and wise
              woman, she became Empress alongside Yudhishthira and played a
              significant role in the events leading up to the Kurukshetra war.

                Hastinapura, a sprawling city on the banks of the Ganges river, served as the capital of the Kuru kingdom in the Mahabharata. Renowned for its wealth and grandeur, Hastinapura was the seat of power for generations of Kuru kings, including the legendary Bhishma, the righteous Yudhishthira, and the cunning Duryodhana. The city boasted magnificent palaces, bustling marketplaces, and a well-trained army that made it a formidable power in the land. However, Hastinapura also became the stage for the Kurukshetra war, a devastating conflict that pitted cousins against each other and forever altered the kingdom's destiny.
